emceemr: Emcee Model Representation
-----------------------------------

`emceemr` (pronounced em-cee-em-er) is a package providing a higher-level interface to the `emcee <http://dan.iel.fm/emcee/>`_ Markov chain Monte Carlo sampler (and possibly other MCMC codes in the future). 

Also included here is an example application of computing the Tip of the Red Giant Branch (for more details on that application see Tollerud et al. 2015 and associated code at https://github.com/eteq/piscdwarfs_hst)
